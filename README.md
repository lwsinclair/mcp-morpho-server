# Morpho API MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for querying the Morpho API. This server enables Claude to interact with Morpho's GraphQL API, providing access to market data, vaults, positions, and more.

## Features

* Query Morpho markets data through GraphQL
* Full support for vaults, positions, and transactions
* Historical APY data and oracle information
* Comprehensive pagination, ordering, and filtering options
* Data validation using Zod schemas
* Error handling and type safety
* MCP-compliant server implementation

## Installation

1. Install the package:
```bash
npm install mcp-morpho-server
```

2. Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:
```json
{
  "tools": {
    "morpho": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/node_modules/mcp-morpho-server/build/index.js"
